# Coding Excercise Solution
My solutions for the two coding questions.

I have filtered my array of objects by selecting the first three sentence pair ids. This was done to ensure that my solution works for the IDs provided in the filtered object.
To complete both questions I would find a way to loop through all the sentence pair Ids and evaluator Ids, rather than selecting each unique ID. This would also allow me to refactor my code and  calculate the averages from a ulimited amount of Ids. 
In order to complete question one I would modifty my solution for question 2 by filtering the evaluator Id rather than sequence ID.
